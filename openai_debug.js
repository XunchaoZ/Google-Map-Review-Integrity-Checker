  What has happened to this place ?  We have patronized restaurant for years and last night was a poor experience
  Server ( bartender ?? ) taking our table was rushed, not checking on us, did not offer food suggestions other than to tell us ( first thing out of her mouth) you know we're out of ribs and low on brisket right ). Not a hello, what can I get for you .  Nothing. Poor start.
  Brisket sandwich was mediocre. Meat dry. No garnish. Fries BARELY warm. Had to ask and remind staff of extra sides that were ordered but not brought. Had specifically asked for extra pickles. None brought. Asked twice. Ketchup was empty at table. No vinegar for fries and no one around to ask about them. No follow up on meal quality by server during meal. No offer of more drinks during meal. But those questions were asked when bringing the cheque ??  Server training 101 not practiced here. Could go on but point is made. Stay away and save your money.
  Has ownership changed here ?  Or new managers ?  Gone WAY down from previous. Won't be back
  Below you can see how much we enjoyed before. Such a shame â€¦`,
